# Introduction

This guide assume you have setup your Raspberry using [RaspiBolt Guide](https://github.com/Stadicus/guides/blob/master/raspibolt/README.md) but may work for other configurations as well with some modifications.

When running Bitcoin and Lightning on a Raspberry it is useful to have more insights into its operation especially since it's a fairly low powered device to begin with.

Furthermore having historical data available could indicate if a software upgrade to any of the components is having an adverse impact.

This may help in debugging all sorts of potential problems, e.g. network latency, CPU performance, hard disk free space etc, or even indicate if you are being targeted by hackers.

This guide has been setup into 3 sections

## [Performance Monitoring](performance_monitoring.md)

Configure recording of system metrics and have it displayed on a website

## [Lightning Metrics](lightning_metrics.md)

Add Lightning specific metrics, e.g. channel size, network capacity

## [Bonus](bonus.md)

Additional activities to make your Raspberry even more awesome
